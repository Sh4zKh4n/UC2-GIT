Here you'll find the schematics for the wiring of the UC2 parts.

Most connections can be established with pin-connection (male/female), as you see in the [simplified tutorial](./ELECTRONICS_FOR_DUMMIES). For durable connection, please solder everything! You're not expected to have perfect soldering skills though. Have a look in the [TUTORIALS](../TUTORIALS) for some soldering guidelines. Be careful not to mix up +/-, otherwise you might cause shortcuts which would very likely fry the Pi or the Arduinos/ESP32s.

## Available schemes and guidelines

## Wire Diagrams/Schematics
All schemes are put together with the Open-Source Software [Fritzing](http://fritzing.org/).

## General Wiring (Arduino Nano; I2C)
For the I2C Bus we use a 4-wire colour-code as follows:

- **5V** - White
- **GND** - Yellow
- **Data** - Green
- **CLK** - Brown

The junctions are connected with [WaGo Snapping Clamps, Compact Wago 2273-203 -> Amazon](https://www.amazon.de/Wago-VERBINDUNGSKLEMME-3POL-2273-203/dp/B075ZRQCGZ):
