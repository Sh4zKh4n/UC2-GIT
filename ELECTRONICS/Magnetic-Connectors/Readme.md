# Magnetic Connectors

## MQTT

Do the following trick:

Connect two wires where you remove the isolation from about 10mm of the plastic and press-fit it into the holes for the ball-magnets and screw it into the holes of the Lids of the cube.  
The impedance is low enough to conduct the current. Make sure you're not swapping ```+/-```. Data channels are provided by ESP32 and MQTT.


## I2C

The following part is only for the pupose of convenience. A few components, such as the xyz stage or the illumination have inbuilt electronics. Control is achieved through a 4-wired I2C BUS. In order to make it work, the electronic components have to be connected to 5V, GND, CLK and DATA.

This can be done be a simple wired connection or alternatively with a set of magnetic connectors to be in-line with the general system design. The CAD files are based on parts which can - so far - only be ordered overseas.

### Link to order the components
You can find the parts [here](https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/Hytepro-usb-panel-mount-magnetic-pogo_60802915253.html?spm=a2700.7724857.normalList.2.78171d18RHvp0G&s=p).
They come in pairs.

### POGO Pins (male/female)
Some images from their website:

### Properties
* 4 pins
* magnetic (600g)

### Setup
The Pogo pins go inside the 3D printed parts (v0). One for the baseplate, one for the cube's lid. There are dedicated holes which makes the process of assembly quiet easy (No possibility to put it in the wrong place).

Additionally, the baseplate holds the "female" version of these magnetic adapters, which don't have the spring loaded contacts. The "male" version goes inside the cube.

### Wiring
If you hold the cube right in front of you and you're facing the bare metal contacts (spring loaded pins), then the left one holds 5V, right one stands for GND. The back-plate goes the same way, so that correct wiring is assured.

### Soldering
Simply put some wires to the end of the Pogo-Pin connectors like that:

Make sure to unplug the power supply when you're not using the electronic parts!
