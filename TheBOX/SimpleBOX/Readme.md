# Simple BOX and MiniBOX
SimpleBOX, equipped with passive components only, covers the basic experiments of ray optics. It is compact and cheap and therefore can be handed to children of all age. It completely covers the classical optics experiments of 7th-8th grade with an overhang to the high school experiments.

Over time, we optimised the SimpleBOX to be cheaper and even simpler and this is what we call the MiniBOX. MiniBOX has only 8 cubes but shows the same experiments as the SimpleBOX. When you print the parts at home, the overall price is around 80 €.

This is a SimpleBOX:

This is a MiniBOX:

The MiniBOX is intended for production by injection molding. The baseplate will come in puzzle-like pieces and therefore it will be possible to build any shape. It will also be possible to stack the cubes and baseplates in multiple layers. Then, no extra sample plate for the z-stage will be needed, but for now, for the 3D printed version it might be useful. Also, for now, use the baseplates listed in the 3D printing list.

Useful for Seconday schools and Hight schools and for Workshops. Get back to us if you want to organize one together with us!

A list of 3D-printed parts and necessary components is found in [BUILD_ME](./BUILD_ME), together with assembly guidelines and some printing tips and tricks.

## The difference between MiniBOX and SimpleBOX
What are the actual differences between those two?
* The SimpleBOX has an eyepiece. This is useful especially for the Smartphone microscope but of course makes the whole BOX more expensive
* The SimpleBOX has a flashlight as a light source. This is very practical, but again it's an extra thing you have to buy. Also, the flashlight we propose is a very strong one and if you're using the BOX with some younger children, you might not want to give the a flashlight for safety reasons
* The SimpleBOX has enough lenses to perform multiple experiments in parallel. This might be useful for demonstrations but it's not necessary for the use in a lecture

You can always advance your MiniBOX with a cube or two.

You also find some education material and more about the setups in DOCUMENTs in english, german, french and czech (condensed materials for some of the experiments [here](./DOCUMENTS/SimpleBOX)). These materials are not completely up to date, as we're currently developing a **MiniBOX booklet**, the comprehensive guide through the experiments and theory of Optics that will support the MiniBOX as a teaching tool. You can find it [here](./DOCUMENTS/MiniBOX_booklet) but keep in mind it's still work in progress. If you have some suggestions for improvement, we'll be happy to hear them!
