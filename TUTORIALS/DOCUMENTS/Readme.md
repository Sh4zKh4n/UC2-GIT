## DOCUMENTS
Here you'll find all the necessary documents for the system.

Please look into the seperate .MD files for further information.

### Uc2 Tutorials
We want to make our system accessable and easy to use. Therefore we have made a small design guide, where we describe the key steps for designing additional components which will be compatible with our system.

* [Assembly Guide for the Incubator Microscope v0](./TUTORIALS/TUT_Assembly_In-Incubator_Microscope_v0.pdf)
* [Design Guide for new customized UC2 inlets v0](./TUTORIALS/TUT_Basic_Design_Cube_Inlet_Function_v0.pdf)

### Bill of Material

All the parts are from typical distributors like Amazon, Alibaba, Ebay, etc. to provide an easy-to-build solution not relying on special components. The project is heavily benefiting from the wide variety and availability of components brought up by the open-source community.

The [GoogleDrive Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U1MndGKRCs0LKE5W8VGreCv9DJbQVQv7O6kgLlB6ZmE/edit?usp=sharing) is an always up-to-date version of the list.

### Resources
We compiled some lists with available low-cost components (e.g. lenses, filters, etc.) to make the setup affordable.
You can find them here:

1. [Resources: Optics, Objective lenses, Filters](./RESOURCES/Resources_Optics.md)
2. [Resources: Light Sources, Lasers](./RESOURCES/Resources_Lightsources.md)
2. [Resources: Electronic Parts, Controlers](./RESOURCES/Resources_Electronics.md)
2. [Resources: Electromechanics, Motors](./RESOURCES/Resources_Mechanics.md)
