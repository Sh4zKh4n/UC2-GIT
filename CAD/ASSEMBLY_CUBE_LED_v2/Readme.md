# LED Cube (+ Pinhole)
This is the repository for the design of the LED Cube. The stl-files can be found in the folder [STL](./STL).

## Purpose
This cube holds a single LED. Optionally, A generic sample holder can be added to hold a pinhole directly in front of the LED.

### Properties
* design is derived from the Base Cube

## Parts

### <img src="../IMAGES/P.png" height="40"> 3D printing parts
* No support needed in all designs
* Carefully remove all support structures (if applicable)

The Cube consists of the following components.

1. **The Lid** where the Arduino + Electronics finds its place ([LID](./STL/10_Lid_1x1_v2.stl))
2. **The Cube** which will be screwed to the Lid. Here all the functions (i.e. Mirrors, LED's etc.) find their place ([BASE](./STL/10_Cube_1x1_v2.stl))
3. **The LED holder Insert** that holds the LED ([LED HOLDER](./STL/ASSEMBLY_CUBE_LED_20_Cube_insert_LED_holder.stl))
4. **The Sample holder Insert** that can hold the pinhole in front of the LED ([SAMPLE HOLDER](./STL/ASSEMBLY_CUBE_LED_20_Cube_insert_Sample_holder.stl))
5. **The Sample holder clamp** that fixes the pinhole in its position ([SAMPLE CLAMP](./STL/ASSEMBLY_CUBE_LED_20_Cube_Insert_Sample_clamp.stl))

* Any LED STAR if you plan to use it for another application
* wires
* Resistor to down-convert the 5V supply-voltage to 2.5V for the LED; e.g. 180R @ 0.5W

#### Pinhole
An easy way to make your own pinhole from aluminium foil is described [here](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/edu/learn/project/how-to-make-a-pinhole-camera/) and [here](https://www.fi.edu/space/eclipse/pinhole-camera).


## <img src="./IMAGES/A.png" height="40"> Assembly
* Remove any support and clean the part
* Solder the wires to the LED
* Insert the LED in its holder
* Slide the LED holder into the Cube Body
* Press the Clamp on the sample holder, slide the holder into the Cube Body in front of the LED
* Add the lid and fix it using a set of M3 screws
* Don't forget to fix the wires of the LED to the screw in the Lid!
* Done!

## Safety
Never (!) look into the LED directly! It may damage your eye immediately!

* ATTENTION: NEVER WATCH DIRECTLY INTO THE LED! EYE WILL BE DAMAGED DIRECTLY
* NEVER SWITCH ON THE LED WITHOUT INTEDED USE
