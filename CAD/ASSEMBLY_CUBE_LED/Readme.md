# LED Cube (+ Pinhole)
This is the repository for the design of the LED Cube.

To acquire the STL-files use the [UC2-Configurator](https://uc2configurator.netlify.app/). The files themselves are in the [RAW](../RAW/STL) folder. The module can be built using injection-moulded (IM) or 3D-printed (3DP) cubes.

## Purpose
This cube holds a single LED. Optionally, A generic sample holder can be added to hold a pinhole directly in front of the LED.

### Properties
* design is derived from the Base Cube

## Parts
The [Bill of Materials](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U1MndGKRCs0LKE5W8VGreCv9DJbQVQv7O6kgLlB6ZmE/edit?usp=sharing) is always the most up-to-date version!

### <img src="../IMAGES/P.png" height="40"> 3D printing parts
* No support needed in all designs
* Carefully remove all support structures (if applicable)

The Cube consists of the following components.

#### Default:
* **IM Cube** which houses the insert and adapts it into a UC2 setup.
* **The LED holder Insert** that holds the LED ([20_Cube_insert_LED_holder_v3.stl](../RAW/STL))
* **The Sample holder Insert** that can hold the pinhole in front of the LED ([20_Cube_insert_Sample_holder_v3.stl](../RAW/STL))
* **The Sample holder clamp** that fixes the pinhole in its position ([20_Cube_Insert_Sample_clamp.stl](../RAW/STL))

#### Alternatives:
* **3DP Cube** which will be screwed to the Lid. Here all the functions (i.e. Mirrors, LED's etc.) find their place ([10_Cube_1x1_v3.stl](../RAW/STL)) and **3DP Lid** which closes the Cube ([10_Lid_1x1_v3.stl](../RAW/STL)) - find the details in [ASSEMBLY_CUBE_Base](../ASSEMBLY_CUBE_Base)
* The **Sample Holder** might not be always necessary but it is used in most of the applications that request this module.


### <img src="./IMAGES/B.png" height="40"> Additional parts
* Check out the [RESOURCES](../../TUTORIALS/RESOURCES) for more information!
* Hi-Power LED 1W/3W UV STAR Blue for the Holography experiment [ðŸ¢‚](https://www.ebay.de/itm/Hi-Power-LED-1W-3W-UV-STAR-Ultraviolet-/131326525056?var=)
* Any LED STAR if you plan to use it for another application
* wires
* Resistor to down-convert the 5V supply-voltage to 2.5V for the LED; e.g. 180R @ 0.5W

#### Pinhole
An easy way to make your own pinhole from aluminium foil is described [here](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/edu/learn/project/how-to-make-a-pinhole-camera/) and [here](https://www.fi.edu/space/eclipse/pinhole-camera).


## <img src="./IMAGES/A.png" height="40"> Assembly
* Solder the wires to the LED
* Insert the LED in its holder
* Slide the LED holder into the Cube Body
* Press the Clamp on the sample holder, slide the holder into the Cube Body in front of the LED
* Close the cube accordingly (IM/3DP)
* Done!


### Tutorial with images
:grey_exclamation: This tutorial shows a UC2_v2 cube but the assembly of the insert is still the same. For assembly of the cube (IM/3DP) check the [ASSEMBLY_CUBE_Base](../ASSEMBLY_CUBE_Base).

## Safety
Never (!) look into the LED directly! It may damage your eye immediately!

* ATTENTION: NEVER WATCH DIRECTLY INTO THE LED! EYE WILL BE DAMAGED DIRECTLY
* NEVER SWITCH ON THE LED WITHOUT INTEDED USE
