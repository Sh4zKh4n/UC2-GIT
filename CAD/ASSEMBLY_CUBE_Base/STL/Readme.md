# BASE CUBE - 3D printing
([TUT01 of TUTORIALS](../../../TUTORIALS))

If you decided to use the 3D-printed Cube and not the injection moulded Cube, here is some useful information :-)

## Parts

### <img src="./IMAGES/P.png" width=40>3D printing parts
The Cube consists of the following components:

* **The Cube Body** where all the functions (i.e. Mirrors, LED's etc.) find their place - inserts that define the function of the cube are placed in the body before closing the lid ([Cube-BASE](UC2_v3_10_Cube_1x1_v3.stl))
* **The Lid** that closes the cube. It is attached by four M3 screws.  ([Cube-LID](UC2_v3_10_Lid_1x1_v3.stl))

The `.stl` files can be directly printed using off-the-shelf 3D printer.

An archive with all the files including the baseplate can be found [here](V3.zip).

* 4Ã— DIN912 M3Ã—12 screws (galvanized steel) [ðŸ¢‚](https://eshop.wuerth.de/Zylinderschraube-mit-Innensechskant-SHR-ZYL-ISO4762-88-IS25-A2K-M3X12/00843%20%2012.sku/de/DE/EUR/)
* 4Ã— DIN912 M3Ã—8 screws (galvanized steel) - or use 8Ã— M3Ã—12

**IMPORTANT: Not all screws are magnetic!**  
It is very important to buy the right screws - the M3 screws need to attach to the magnets and therefore it is crucial that they are magnetic. STAINLESS STEEL IS GENERALLY NOT A MAGNETIC MATERIAL. THE SCREWS HAVE TO BE MADE OF GALVANIZED STEEL. If you want to know more about why not all steel is magnetic you can read about it [here](https://monnigindustry.com/2020/12/23/is-galvanized-steel-magnetic-why-or-why-not/). Unfortunately, the DIN 912 / ISO 4762 screws that we propose can be made of both and you can frequently find both at the same vendor.    
The take-home message is: **The M3 screws have be made of galvanized steel and never stainless steel!**  
Check out the [RESOURCES](../../../TUTORIALS/RESOURCES/Resources_Mechanics.md) for sources of the right screws.

For general advice on 3D printing, have a look in the [TUTORIALS](../../../TUTORIALS#3d-printing).

### 3D printer settings

* Quality: Normal, 0,15 mm layer height
* Support: None
* Infill: 20%
* Adhesion: None if possible, otherwise brim
* Material: PLA/ABS/other
* Printing time: ~3:40 h

1. Download both .stl files - `UC2_v3_10_Cube_1x1_v3.stl` and `UC2_v3_10_Lid_1x1_v3.stl` or download and extract the `V3.zip`.
1. Place the files in your slicer and use the above settings. Leave the rest of the settings as default or based on the experience you have with your printer.
1. Slice it, save it, print it!

### Video Tutorial
A quick printing tutorial can be found here (Note: the Video shows a UC2_v2 cube):

## Confusion about versions

The current version of the UC2 system is called v3. We're trying hard to update the APPlications so that everything is based on the new design, but it's a lot of files and there are probably still some forgotten v0 and v2 parts.

If you're unsure, check out the [Modular Developer Kit](../../../MDK) - there you find a general definition of the shape and size of the inserts which is up to date!

The outer cube dimensions stayed the same, but the inserts changed a lot!

[HERE (v0)](V0.zip) and [HERE (v2)](V2.zip) you find the old cube - just as a reference!
