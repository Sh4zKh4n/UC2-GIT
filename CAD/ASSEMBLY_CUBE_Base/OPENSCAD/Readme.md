## BASE CUBE Design Files

These files were generated using OpenSCAD.

It was designed by participant of the Photonik Akademie 2019 and updated to v3 by the UC2 core team.

Here you find three files:
* [10_Cube_Lid_1x1_v3.scad](10_Cube_Lid_1x1_v3.scad) that contains the Cube Body and the Lid. Find the details about this design in the [MDK](../../../MDK) in in the [CAD Module description](../)
* [10_Base_puzzle_v3.scad](10_Base_puzzle_v3.scad) that can be customised to have the puzzles fit properly. Find the details in [ASSEMBLY Baseplate](../../ASSEMBLY_Baseplate).
* [20_Insert_Perpendicular_blank_v3.scad](20_Insert_Perpendicular_blank_v3.scad) that carries a generic insert design - just the dimension that are necessary for fitting inside a cube, no function. You can use it to design your own insert.

To start working on it, you have to do the following steps:

* Download the file you want to work with and open it in openSCAD
* Change the design as you need
* Render it, export an STL file and print it
* Let us know about your ideas and updates! ([CONTRIBUTING](../../../CONTRIBUTING.md))
