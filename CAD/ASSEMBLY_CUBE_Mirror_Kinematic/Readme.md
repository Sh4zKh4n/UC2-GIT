# Kinematic Mirror Holder Cube
This is the repository for the Kinematic Mirror Holder Cube.

To acquire the STL-files use the [UC2-Configurator](https://uc2configurator.netlify.app/). The files themselves are in the [RAW](../RAW/STL) folder. The module can be built using injection-moulded (IM) or 3D-printed (3DP) cubes.

## Purpose
It adapts a mirror to the UC2 system. It allows precise tilting in *x* and *y*.

### Properties
* design is derived from the base-cube
* the adapter holds a 30Ã—30 mm Â² toy-mirror or a 1 inch circular mirror (e.g. Thorlabs part) at 45 degrees in a UC2 base cube
* the here used mirror has the following parameters:
	* Diameter: 25,4mm
	* Reflectance
	* Surface Flatness: (Peak to Valley) Î»/10 @ 633 nm
	* Substrate Fused: Silica
	* Thickness: 6.0 mm (0.24")

## Parts
The [Bill of Materials](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U1MndGKRCs0LKE5W8VGreCv9DJbQVQv7O6kgLlB6ZmE/edit?usp=sharing) is always the most up-to-date version!

### <img src="../IMAGES/P.png" height="40"> 3D printing parts
* No support needed in all designs
* Carefully remove all support structures (if applicable)

The Cube consists of the following components.

#### Default:
* **IM Cube** which houses the insert and adapts it into a UC2 setup.
* **The Kinematic Mirror Holder Base** which holds the three screws that change the tilt of the mirror ([20_Cube_Insert_Kinematic_Mirrormount_base_v3.stl])
* **The Mirror (30Ã—30 mm) Holder for the Kinematic Mirror Holder** which holds the Mirror on the front side and three magnets on the back. For 30Ã—30mmÂ² Toy mirror ([20_Cube_Insert_Kinematic_Mirrormount_Plate.stl](../RAW/STL))

#### Alternatives:
* **3DP Cube** which will be screwed to the Lid. Here all the functions (i.e. Mirrors, LED's etc.) find their place ([10_Cube_1x1_v3.stl](../RAW/STL)) and **3DP Lid** which closes the Cube ([10_Lid_1x1_v3.stl](../RAW/STL)) - find the details in [ASSEMBLY_CUBE_Base](../ASSEMBLY_CUBE_Base)
* **The Mirror (Thorlabs) Holder for the Kinematic Mirror Holder** which holds the Mirror on the front side and three magnets on the back. For a 1 inch Thorlabs mirror ([20_Cube_Insert_Kinematic_Mirrormount_Thorlabsadapter.stl](../RAW/STL))

* or 1Ã— Thorlabs PF10-03-P01 - Protected Silver Mirror [ðŸ¢‚](https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=903)
* For better precision, we use a custom cut metal plate (30Ã—40 mm, galvanized steel) instead of the 3D-printed plate to hold the mirror.


## <img src="./IMAGES/A.png" height="40"> Assembly
* Insert three M3 screw into the holes in the mirror holder. There are four holes - the one in the center of the part stays empty! Make sure you are using the correct holes
* Slide the mirror holder into the Cube
* Close the cube accordingly (IM/3DP)
* Insert the ballmagnets into the mirror holder.
* Glue/Insert your mirror to the holder. For the sticky mirror: place the mirror roughly in the center of the plate
* Attach the mirror holder to the ends of the screws of the kinematic mirror base using the magnets of the mirror holder and the screws of the base
* Done!


### Tutorial with images
:grey_exclamation: This tutorial shows a UC2_v2 cube but the assembly of the insert is still the same. For assembly of the cube (IM/3DP) check the [ASSEMBLY_CUBE_Base](../ASSEMBLY_CUBE_Base).

**Note:**  
The previous version of this module used a metal plate instead of the 3D printed plate. However, the metal plates are not generally available (We had them custom cut in a mechanical workshop). Other than that, the assembly is still the same - have a look in step 8.  
The metal plates limit the play between the magnets and screws, so it might be a more stable solution.

1. All parts for this model

6. Here you see the 3D printed plate. Simply press the ballmagnets into the holes of the plate using pliers.

## Safety
Don't touch the mirror surface!
