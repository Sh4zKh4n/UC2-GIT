# Cube Insert OpenFlexure Stage LED Matrix
This part adapts the OpenFlexure stage from Richard Bowman's group at the Bath University to the modular optical system UC2. It is basically a plate which has  11 ball-magnets on one side to adapt to 3 UC2 cubes and a flat surface equipped with 2 holes to adapt to the open flexure stage.

It's a work in progress!

## Purpose
The [OpenFlexure Stage](https://www.openflexure.org) can be downloaded from the official [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/openflexure/openflexure-microscope)-Repository. It's a monolithic XYZ-stage with tremendous precision.


## Properties

OpenFlexure Stage stacked on the UC2 cubes. A fold-mirror can redirect the beam from the objective lens inside the Z-slide of the stage.
