## BASE CUBE Design Files

These files were generated using OpenSCAD.

It was designed by participant of the Photonik Akademie 2019 (with some slight changes from UC2 core team).

To start working on it, you have to do the following steps:

* Download the [UC2_Cube_Lid_1x1_v2.scad](UC2_Cube_Lid_1x1_v2.scad) file and open it in openSCAD
* Use the Customizer
  * In the View menu, the option called [Hide customizer] must be unselected to display the customizer
  * Choose whether you need both the Cube Body and the Lid or just one of them
  * Render it, export an STL file and print it
* Without the customizer: Comment/Uncomment the respective part to chose which one you render

The [UC2_Insert_Perpendicular.scad](UC2_Insert_Perpendicular.scad) file carries a generic insert design - just the dimension that are necessary for fitting inside a cube, no function. You can use it to design your own insert.
