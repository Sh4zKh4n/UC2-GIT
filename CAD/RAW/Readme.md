## RAW CAD Files

In this folder we provide all design (```.ipt```) and exported (```.stl```)-files. We want to serve them through the UC2 configurator which will appear very soon. 

## Export from Autodesk Inventor

### IPT files

Save as -> Pack 'n go -> save somewhere and copy the ```.ipt``` files in the [IPT](.\IPT)-folder).

### STL files

Export -> export as STL and hit options -> individual files. 
Rename them with e.g. Bulkrenamer or so.
