# Contributing to UC2

## Get Involved

This project is open so that anyone can get involved. You don't even have to learn CAD designing or programming. Ways you can contribute include:

* General / Documentation
  * Share your results - setups you've built or things you've seen with them - on Twitter using [#openUc2](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23openUc2&src=typed_query)
  * Get involved in discussions in the [ISSUE-section](https://github.com/bionanoimaging/UC2-GIT/issues).
  * Raise an issue if you spot something that's wrong, or something that could be improved. This includes the instructions/documentation.
  * Suggest better text or images for the instructions.
  * Fork it, and make pull requests - documentation improvements are every bit as useful as a new design or software improvement.
* Hardware / Design
  * We support you with the basic CAD design files, so that you can develop specific hardware-function which can fit in our cubes.
  * We provide a brief tutorial on how to design an insert which adapts any part to the UC2 system. Please find it [here](./CAD/ASSEMBLY_CUBE_Base_v2/#tutorial-on-how-to-design-an-insert-in-inventor) on how to design an insert in Inventor.
  * Improve the design of parts STL files or descriptions of changes are helpful, even if you don't use OpenSCAD or Inventor.
* Software
  * Our software-oriented [UC2-SOFTWARE-GIT](https://github.com/bionanoimaging/UC2-Software-GIT) provides you with all the different programs that you need to automate your blocks.
  * Run our GUI on [RasPi](https://github.com/bionanoimaging/UC2-Software-GIT/tree/master/GUI/RASPBERRY_PI/RASPIapp_py3) or [Android-Phone](https://github.com/bionanoimaging/UC2-Software-GIT/tree/master/GUI/Android/UC2-TheBox).
  * Setup your [Arduino](https://github.com/bionanoimaging/UC2-Software-GIT/tree/master/HARDWARE_CONTROL/ARDUINO) or [ESP32](https://github.com/bionanoimaging/UC2-Software-GIT/tree/master/HARDWARE_CONTROL/ESP32).
  * We want to generalize our Software to even integrate more with community standards and have an overall compatibility with different Operating Systems. Get **INVOLVED** by:
    * switching to a new browser-based GUI
	* improving our MQTT based connection routines and trying to improve the necessary hardware-flashes
	* adding totally unknown functions
	* making our Software as modular as possible
* Things in need of attention are currently described in issues so have a look there if you'd like to work on something but aren't sure what.
