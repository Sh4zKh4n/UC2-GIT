## Applications
<a href="#icon01" name="icon01"><img src="../IMAGES/signpost.png" width=30></a> Here you can find all the optical setups we tested or proposed so far.

* For printing and assembly of all the cubes and modules go to [CAD](../CAD)
* For setups compilations go to [TheBOX](../TheBOX)
* For beginner's tutorials, how-to guides and more guidelines go to [TUTORIALS](../TUTORIALS)
* For information on the electronic parts go to [ELECTRONICS](../ELECTRONICS)
* For information on the software go to the dedicated repository [UC2-Software-GIT](https://github.com/bionanoimaging/UC2-Software-GIT)
* For the Bill of Materials go to [RESOURCES](../TUTORIALS/RESOURCES)
* For anything else, have a look at the [SITEMAP](../SITEMAP.md)

This is a growing list of available optical setups coming along with tutorials and alignment instructions. The most important part is the core building block as you find in every modular toolbox. A detailed description of the the **UC2** cube can be found [here](../CAD/ASSEMBLY_CUBE_Base_v2/Readme.md).

## General Naming Convetion and Structure of UC2
![](./IMAGES/UC2_Structure.png)

## Confusion about version v0 vs. version v2

We made a change in the CAD design of the cube in order to be more generic (e.g. point symmetry around the center). We're trying hard to update the APPlications so that everything is based on the new design, but it's a lot of files and there are probably still some forgotten v0 parts.

If you're unsure, check out the [Modular Developer Kit](../MDK) - there you find a general definition of the shape and size of the inserts which is up to date!

The outer cube dimensions stayed the same, but the inserts changed completely!
