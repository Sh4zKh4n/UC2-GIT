# Abbe Diffraction Experiment
This is the repository for the Abbe Diffraction Experiment. It has two cameras where one captures the Fourier plane and the other acquires the image plane.

## Setup
This is based on old cubes, but the order is the same. All lenses have 50mm focal length.

## Devices' features:

* Capture Fourier Plane
* Capture Image Plane
* Low-cost acquisition
* Open-Source
* Compatible with Educational purposes
