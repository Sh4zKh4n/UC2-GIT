## openSIM

This is the repository for the openSIM project which integrates structured illumination microscopy into the UC2-system.

ðŸ§¾ The manuscript for the openISM and openSIM can be found under the [DOI:10.1101/2021.01.08.425840](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.08.425840)

***Fig 1:*** *This is the ready-to-print module which clicks into the UC2-system*



This module is based on the work by the Huser-Lab and can be found as a preprint on BioarxivÂ [1]. It uses a low-cost single-mode diode laser (532 nm) and a Raspberry Pi driven DMD module to generate a structured illumination for microscopy. Since we use coherent illumination, we can create pattern suitable for SIM in order to increase the lateral resolution. So far we're not aiming for any super-resolution, but rather give a proof of principle.

***Fig 2:*** *A beam-expander magnifies the collimated beam which hits the DMD displaying a set of gratings*

The angle between the collimated and expanded Laser-beam and the DMD is 25Â° in order to get the maximum in the diffracted orders.

***Fig 3:*** *The full system based on the modular cubes*

The system of a classical two-beam interference SIM is straight forward and based on common 4f (i.e. fourier imaging) system, where focal lengtheses of adjacent lenses are following each other. The core idea is to place two delta-peaks inside the BFP of the objective lens. The lens fourier-transforms the peaks and therefore form a grating in the sample plane.

In order to keep the whole system small, the telescope imaging the DMD is  based on two lenses with ***f'=50mm*** (e.g. Thorlabs achromates). A tube-lens of ***f'=180mm*** fourier-transforms the image folded by the mirror and places the different diffraction order inside the BFP of the objective lens. To produce 2D-Sim a fourier mask in the fourier-plane after the DMD, blocks the zeroth order.

The DMD, driven by a Raspberry Pi, gets illuminated by a more-less plane wave from a coherent laser source. The pattern which are displayed are then actually coherently reimaged inside the sample plane by the whole system.
