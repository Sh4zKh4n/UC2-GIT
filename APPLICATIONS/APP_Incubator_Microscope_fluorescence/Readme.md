# In-Incubator Microscope with fluorescence module
This is the repository for the in-incubator microscope. It is capable to acquire Time-Lapse videos from living cells inside an incubator.

The current version of the Z-stage is inspired by the flexure-bearing Z-stage from Richard Bowman's openflexure microscope design. Their open-source project can be found [here](https://openflexure.org).

Each functional block has an Arduino acting as a BUS-communicator. Therefore it's possible to control (i.e. switch on/off) devices from the MASTER-device (i.e. Raspberry pi). We aim to build a low-cost solution for high throughput acquisitions, acting as a new tools for (not only) biologists.

It is a very early developer version. Please feel free to contribute to the documentation and device development.

### <img src="./IMAGES/P.png" width="40"> 3D-printing
To acquire the STL-files use the [UC2-Configurator](https://uc2configurator.netlify.app/). The files themselves are in the [RAW](../../CAD/RAW/STL) folder. The module can be built using injection-moulded (IM) or 3D-printed (3DP) cubes.
